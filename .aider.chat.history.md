#### explain  

Sure, I'm here to help you make changes to your code. You can tell me what you want to change or add to your code, and I'll guide you through the process. I'll tell you which files need to be modified and provide detailed instructions on how to make the changes. I'll use a specific format to show the original code and the updated code. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.


#### use OpenAI API key in Streamlit Community Cloud  

To use the OpenAI API key in Streamlit Community Cloud, you should not hardcode the key in your script due to security reasons. Instead, you should use Streamlit's secrets management system. 

Here are the steps to do it:

1. Go to the Streamlit Cloud dashboard.
2. Select the app you want to add secrets to.
3. Click on the 'Edit Secrets' button.
4. A text box will appear. Add your secrets in JSON format. For example:
```json
{
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
}
```
5. Click 'Save'. Your secrets are now securely stored and can be accessed in your app.

Now, let's modify your code to use the OpenAI API key from Streamlit's secrets.

```python
Chatbot.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
with st.sidebar:
    openai_api_key = st.text_input("OpenAI API Key", key="chatbot_api_key", type="password")
=======
with st.sidebar:
    openai_api_key = st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

In the updated code, `st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"]` fetches the OpenAI API key from the secrets you stored in Streamlit Cloud.
